# Things we can expect everyone to want
- Getting fair matches against people of equal skill level
- Having as little of a skill disparity as possible within a team in team games
- Having a nice cooperative experience in team games
- Not getting flamed by teammates in team games

# Things some people might want (not necessarily all of them, so there will be contradictions):
- Having some appreciation for their time investment into the game, being recognisable as veterans
- Getting motivated to get better at the game resp. getting some appreciation for their efforts to get better
- Know how they measure up against specific other players or generally within the community
- Being able to play a chill game where they are not ecessarily expected to perform their best
- Being able to expect their team mates to perform their best
- Having as much control over the outcome of their match as possible
- Not having their rank being pushed in their face all the ime, so they don't get anxious about losing it
- Getting a feeling for what to expect from your team mates in eam games
- Seeing whether their opponent or the opposing team has a kill advantage as expectation management mechanism

# Looking at this, two things become apparent
1. We really need to get rid of the 8v8-atg meta towards a more diverse game mode scene.
2. We need a good party system to give players a better chance to get rid of the intra-team dynamics of randomly assembled teams, if they want.
3. A lot of this can't be reasonably solved by the client alone, but is more of a communications issue.
