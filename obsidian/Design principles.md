### Use case driven design
all functionality should have a clear use case that defines its raison d'être
### Clear priorities for functionality
The most used functionalities and 90%-cases should be accessible as easily and quickly as possible

We have a clearly visible prioritisation scheme on the UI that makes it easy to understand which parts are the focus of the game.
### Clear priorities for the design
We favour simplicity and clarity over customisability. We avoid settings that ask players to effectively make design decisions for us unnecessarily. → more Apple, less Microsoft
### Matchmaking-centric approach
We Switch from a lobby-centric approach to matchmaking as much as possible with the goal of having explicit lobbies make up for up to 20% of PvP matches at most.
### BAR is a game and not a desktop application
While ease of use and efficiency are key, we don't forget that this is a game and should feel like a game. Therefore, we give enough room to elements that aren't exactly needed for the functionality to work but support immersion.
### Tailored solutions rather than one-size-fits-all approaches
We provide UI elements that are tailored to their respective use case rather than generic "one size fits all" solutions.
### Parties of players as first-class citizens 
We promote playing with friends and making them within the community by providing a solid party system.

We make parties a first-class citizen by giving it a dedicated space on the main screen and supporting matchmaking with parties. The UI properly reacts to a party being formed by removing Single Player items and replacing them with party-specific ones.
