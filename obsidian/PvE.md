# Possible PvE scenarios
- Scavengers
- Raptors
- vs. AI (vanilla)

# Possible player constellations
- Player playing together with randoms
- Player playing together with friends in a party
- A combination of both - a party playing with additional randoms

# Conclusio
The result of this, functionality-wise is that for each of the three base scenarios, we can create a closed lobby (case "party") or an open one (both cases with randoms).

As in contrast to the PvP case, there is no straightforward standard setup that can be assumed, so matchmaking doesn't seem to be a thing, but we'll rather have to use a lobby. However, this lobby can differ heavily from the PvP lobby, as the needs of the game modes are very different.
