# BAR Lobby

BAR Lobby is a new WIP lobby for the RTS game [Beyond All Reason](https://www.beyondallreason.info/). It hopes to boldly go where no Spring client has gone before, providing a more streamlined experience, with good visuals and UX being high priority. The ultimate goal of BAR Lobby is to replace all other lobbies when it comes to playing BAR. If a significant amount of people don't wish to use it because of reasons such as functionality or speed, then this project is going very wrong.

## [Docs](https://beyond-all-reason.github.io/bar-lobby/)

## Functionality and Goals

-   Provide functionality for everything related to BAR. Campaigns, Missions, Multiplayer, Replays etc
-   Simple and intutive codebase, lots of documenation for contributing
-   Steam integration, automatic account creation and login
-   Smooth, seemless, fully integrated downloads. Content should be preloaded when sensible
-   Communicate entirely via Teiserver's new protocol, [Tachyon](https://github.com/beyond-all-reason/teiserver/tree/master/documents/tachyon). No support for the legacy SpringLobbyProtocol
-   TLS only, no unencypted comms
