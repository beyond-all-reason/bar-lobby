# How to Contribute

Thank you for your interest in contributing to BAR Lobby! As a project driven entirely by volunteers, we depend on community contributions to move forward and thrive. We appreciate you being here to help.

## Communication

If you haven't already, join our Discord at https://discord.gg/beyond-all-reason and select the "Development Role" in the "Channels & Roles" section. The [#new-client](https://discord.com/channels/549281623154229250/927564746104905728) channel is dedicated to everything related to BAR Lobby.

Please feel free to ask questions and seek help from the community in the channel. Often, a fellow contributor can provide a quick answer!

While Discord is our primary communication tool, it is an ephemeral medium. To keep the project organized, all binding discussions, decisions, and code contributions must be recorded on GitHub. This allows us to track changes and decisions in a structured way that can be referenced later. If you see a discussion on Discord that should be preserved, please help us by creating an issue or pull request to document it.

## A Note on Reviews & Merging

While BAR project is large, this repository is _currently_ maintained primarily by a single person, [Marek](https://github.com/p2004a/), who is also working on other part of [infrastructure](https://beyond-all-reason.github.io/infrastructure/). We are deeply grateful for every contribution, but this means our time is very limited.

We will do our best to review and respond to pull requests within **7 days**. However, there may be times when we are unavailable, and responses might take longer. We appreciate your patience. You can check the maintainer's status on Discord or GitHub to see if an absence is noted in their profile.

**We are actively seeking senior engineers interested in a leadership role.** If you have the experience and passion to help guide the project's architecture and mentor other contributors, please reach out on Discord. Your involvement would be instrumental in ensuring the long-term health and sustainability of this project.

## New Contributor Guide

If you are new to contributing to open source projects on GitHub, we recommend familiarizing yourself with the documentation at https://docs.github.com/en/get-started, especially:

- [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow)
- [Collaborating with Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests)

## Getting Started

1.  **Help Review Pull Requests:** A great way to start is by helping to review open PRs. This helps you learn the codebase, helps the contributor get faster feedback, and helps the maintainers save time.
2.  Get an overview of the project by reading the [README](README.md) file.
3.  Set up your local development environment by following the steps in the [README](README.md) file.
4.  Take a look at [issues tagged with the "good first issue" tag](https://github.com/beyond-all-reason/bar-lobby/contribute).
5.  If you have any questions, need help, find something ambiguous, or want to work on something not well scoped yet or without an issue, **please, please discuss it with us**! We want to ensure that we are aligned, you aren't wasting your time, and you have a good experience!
6.  Develop the change we all agreed on, and send it for review following the [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow) process.

## Other Ways to Contribute

Code is just one part of the project. We are always in need of other skills! If you're interested in helping with design, documentation, testing, UI design, art or community management, please talk to us on Discord. We will try to find something for you to do. ☺️
