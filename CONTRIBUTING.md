# How to Contribute

Thank you for your interest in contributing to BAR Lobby! Everything in Beyond All Reason is done by volunteers, and we need help to ensure that the project progresses.

## Communication

If you haven't already, join our Discord at https://discord.gg/beyond-all-reason and select the "Development Role" in the "Channels & Roles" section. The [#new-client](https://discord.com/channels/549281623154229250/927564746104905728) channel is dedicated to everything related to BAR Lobby.

Discord is _the_ primary communication method for everyone developing BAR (and, of course, for players).

## New Contributor Guide

If you are new to contributing to open source projects on GitHub, we recommend familiarizing yourself with the documentation at https://docs.github.com/en/get-started, especially:

- [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow)
- [Collaborating with Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests)

## Getting Started

1. Get an overview of the project by reading the [README](README.md) file.
2. Set up your local development environment by following the steps in the [README](README.md) file.
3. Take a look at [issues tagged with the "good first issue" tag](https://github.com/beyond-all-reason/bar-lobby/contribute).
4. If you have any questions, need help, find something ambiguous, or want to work on something not well scoped yet or without an issue, **please, please discuss it with us**! We want to ensure that we are aligned, you aren't wasting your time, and you have a good experience!
5. Develop the change we all agreed on, and send it for review following the [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow) process.

## I want to contribute, but not code!

Great! There are plenty of other skills we can use in the project. Talk to us on Discord, and we will try to find something for you ☺️.
