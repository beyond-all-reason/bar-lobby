This is not a license. We do not have a correct license for this asset.

Files without a license need to be treated as All Rights Reserved, and
effectively everything is prohibited.

DO NOT DO ANYTHING WITH THOSE FILES WITHOUT CHECKING WITH COPYRIGHT HOLDER.

Resolution of this issue is tracked in https://github.com/beyond-all-reason/bar-lobby/issues/398,
all files that don't have a license are owned by somebody in the BAR
organization, we assume their good intentions, and we checked they are fine
to have those files still present here, but CONDITIONS ARE UNKNOWN.

DO NOT DO ANYTHING WITH THOSE FILES WITHOUT CHECKING WITH COPYRIGHT HOLDER.

YOU MUST NOT ADD ANY NEW ASSETS LIKE THIS.
