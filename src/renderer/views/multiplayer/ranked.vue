- Matchmaking queue toggles for 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4, 5v5, 6v6, 7v7, 8v8, Small FFA (3 - 5), Medium FFA (6 - 10), Large FFA (11 - 16), TeamFFA
- Show current rank for each playlist
- Big shiny queue button, changes to cancel queue when queued already
- Ready modal popup when match is found, shows status like 9/10 players ready

Ranked differences:

- New ranking system that makes more sense for ranked games, publicly visible
- No spectators
- Can't resign individually but can 'abandon' which incurs a penalty
- Team surrender only possible after x time and requires team approval (80%?)
- Player being AFK for more than x minutes counts as abandon
- Players who abandon are punished in some way, lower reputation, banned from matchmaking for x time or something
