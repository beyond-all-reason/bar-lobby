# What is this directory?

This directory and its contents are a placeholder for the future git submodule that will manage translation files for both this repository and the main game repository, which will itself be managed through Transifex.

### Do not edit any files in the `lang` folder manually, except for this READEME.md

All other files are managed automatically!

## How to contribute:

### If you can, join the translation channel on [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/549281623154229250/1066060678860914780)
It is the main way in which most `BaR` devolopers, contributors and volunteers communicate.

### Step 1
Register for a free Transifex account with the BAR Transifex project by clicking the JOIN THIS PROJECT button:<br>
https://explore.transifex.com/bar-team/beyond-all-reason-localization/

### Step 2
Read the translation guide below this post, also available as a Google Doc for those without Discord:<br>
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TdPksGCztmQVsU69bKMUDPNJXBL5araZbIozJyL7VDI/edit?usp=sharing

### Step 3
Start translating!
Post any questions in the Discord translation channel. Feel free to invite your friends who want to help translate, they do not need a Discord account!

### For Developers
